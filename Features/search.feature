Feature: Search
    In order to do a search
    As an anonymous user
    I need to be able to make a search

    # @NOTICE:  'When I search for "<data>"' sentence is high level BDD 
    #   for low level BDD:
    #          Given I am at "home" page
    #           When I fill "top search" input with "<data>"
    #            And I press "enter" key
    #           Then I am at "search" page

    ###
    # Basic functionality
    ###
    Scenario: Make a simple search
       Given I am at "home" page
        When I search for "home"
        Then I see "1" search results

    Scenario: No results will display that string wasn't found
       Given I am at "home" page
        When I search for "this-value-doesnt-exist"
        Then I see "0" search results
         And I see message "No results were found when searching for \"this-value-doesnt-exist\""

    # Q: these "tips" scenarios could be merged to the above scenarios, should they?
    Scenario: No results will display search tips
       Given I am at "home" page
        When I search for "this-value-doesnt-exist"
        Then I see "0" search results
         And I see search tips

    Scenario: If search returns values search tips won't be displayed
       Given I am at "home" page
        When I search for "home"
        Then I see "1" search results
         And I see no search tips

    Scenario Outline: Search field is present in every page
       Given I am at "home" page
        When I click at "<page>" link
        Then I see "search" input

        Examples: 
            | page      |
            | Tag cloud |
            | Site map  |
            | Register  |
            | Login     |

    Scenario: Search for empty string
       Given I am at "search" page
        When I search for ""
        Then I see "0" search results
